# Talos
Talos is a graduate business managing program, with an emphasis on the sales, meant to replicate a real world organization's solution and it is meant to work with the demo AdventureWorks2019 database but changes can easily be implemented to work with real existing databases.
It was created as a project for academic purposes, but through that our team that consists of three students, gained a deeper understanding of C# and Microsfot SQL as well as better, cleaner programming practices and overall sql/database management knowledge.
